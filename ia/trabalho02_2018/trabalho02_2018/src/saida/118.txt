RESUMO: Abstract—Fuzzy systems consisting of networked rule bases,called fuzzy networks, capture various types of imprecision inher-ent in financial data and in the decision-making processes on them.This paper introduces a novel extension of the technique for order-ing of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methodand uses fuzzy networks to solve multicriteria decision-makingproblems where both benefit and cost criteria are presented assubsystems. Thus, the decision maker evaluates the performanceof each alternative for portfolio optimization and further observesthe performance for both benefit and cost criteria. This approachimproves significantly the transparency of the TOPSIS methods,while ensuring high effectiveness in comparison with establishedapproaches. The proposed method is further tested to solve theproblem of selection/ranking of traded equity covering developedand emergent financial markets. The ranking produced by themethod is validated using Spearman rho rank correlation. Basedon the case study, the proposed method outperforms the existingTOPSIS approaches in terms of ranking performance.
