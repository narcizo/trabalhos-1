RESUMO: Abstract—This paper considers a statistical signal processingproblem involving agent-based models of financial markets, whichat a microlevel are driven by socially aware and risk-averse agents.These agents trade (buy or sell) stocks at each trading instant byusing the decisions of all previous agents (social learning) in addi-tion to a private (noisy) signal they receive on the value of thestock. We are interested in the following: 1) modelling the dynam-ics of these risk averse agents and 2) sequential detection of amarket shock based on the behaviour of these agents. Structuralresults that characterize social learning under a risk measure,conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), are presented and formulationof the Bayesian change point detection problem is provided. Thestructural results exhibit two interesting properties: 1) risk averseagents herd more often than risk neutral agents and 2) the stop-ping set in the sequential detection problem is nonconvex. Theframework is validated on data from the Yahoo! Tech Buzz gamedataset and it is revealed that 1) the model identifies the valuechanges based on agent’s trading decisions. 2) Reasonable quickestdetection performance is achieved when the agents are risk-averse.
