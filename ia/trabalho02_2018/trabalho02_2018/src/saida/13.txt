RESUMO: Abstract— Feedback controllers are introduced to help managean individual’s or household’s financial life and build savings. Thecontrollers can be viewed as financial advisors for an individual’sresource allocation problem, which is modeled as a nonlineardiscrete time stochastic system with income uncertainties, assetlosses, and constraints on cash flow and credit. We introduce amodel predictive controller (MPC) and a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, and compare them with a benchmarkmethod employed in finance and economics, stochastic dynamicprogramming (DP). Both MPC and PID produce similar consis-tency in financial management compared with DP. They alsooffer the advantage of low computational complexity relativeto DP, which allows us to efficiently perform assessments ofrobustness (reliability) and disturbance rejection (e.g., effects ofuncertainties), both of which are of significant practical engineer-ing importance. In addition, this flexibility enables us to uncoverthe system’s properties, such as the existence of a “povertytrap" caused by constraints in the control space and dynamics.The effectiveness of a PID-based aid intervention for low-skilledand low-endowed agents that lie within the trap is assessedand contrasted with other existing cash transfer programs, withresults that support a further implementation analysis. Theseassessments constitute a novel application of feedback controllersthat, besides effectively dealing with scarcity constraints, presentpractical advantages that are shown to translate into an abilityto implement the MPC or PID controller in a variety of waysfor low-income individuals via computer-assistive methods (e.g.,a cell phone).
