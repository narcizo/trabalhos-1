RESUMO: Abstract—Much research has been conducted arguing that tip-ping points at which complex systems experience phase transitionsare difficult to identify. To test the existence of tipping points infinancial markets, based on the alternating offer strategic modelwe propose a network of bargaining agents who mutually either co-operate or compete, where the feedback mechanism between trad-ing and price dynamics is driven by an external “hidden” variableR that quantifies the degree of market overpricing. Due to the feed-back mechanism, R fluctuates and oscillates over time, and thusperiods when the market is underpriced and overpriced occur re-peatedly. As the market becomes overpriced, bubbles are createdthat ultimately burst as the market reaches a crash tipping pointRc . The market starts recovering from the crash as a recovery tip-ping point Rr is reached. The probability that the index will dropin the next year exhibits a strong hysteresis behavior very muchalike critical transitions in other complex systems. The probabilitydistribution function of R has a bimodal shape characteristic ofsmall systems near the tipping point. By examining the S&P500index we illustrate the applicability of the model and demonstratethat the financial data exhibit tipping points that agree with themodel. We report a cointegration between the returns of the S&P500 index and its intrinsic value.
