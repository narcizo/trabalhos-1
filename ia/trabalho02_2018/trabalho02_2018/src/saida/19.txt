RESUMO: Abstract—Financial markets typically undergo periods of pros-perity followed by periods of stagnation, and this undulation makesit challenging to maintain market efficiency. The efficient markethypothesis (EMH) states that there exist differences in structuralcomplexity in security prices between regular and abnormal sit-uations. Yet, despite a clear link between market acceleration (cf.recession in security prices) and stress in physical systems, indicesof financial stress still have significant scope for further develop-ment. The overarching aim of this work is therefore to determinethe characteristics of financial indices related to financial stress,and to establish a robust metric for the extent of such ‘stress’. Thisis achieved based on intrinsic multiscale analysis which quanti-fies the so called complexity-loss hypothesis in the context of fi-nancial stress. The multiscale sample entropy and our proposedAssessment of Latent Index of Stress methods have successfullyassessed financial stress, and have served as a measure to establishan analogy between transitions from ‘normal’ (relaxed) to ‘abnor-mal’ (stressed) financial periods with the sympatho-vagal balancein humans. Four major stock indices of the US economy over thepast 25 years are considered: (i) Dow Jones Industrial Average, (ii)NASDAQ Composite, (iii) Standard & Poor’s 500, and (iv) Rus-sell 2000, together with FTSE 100, CAC 40 and exchange rates.Our findings support the EMH theory and reveal high stress forboth the periods of Internet bubble burst and sub-prime mortgagecrisis.
