RESUMO: Abstract—Classification techniques are becoming essential in thefinancial world for reducing risks and possible disasters. Managersare interested in not only high accuracy, but in interpretability andtransparency as well. It is widely accepted now that the compre-hension of how inputs and outputs are related to each other iscrucial for taking operative and strategic decisions. Furthermore,inputs are often affected by contextual factors and characterizedby a high level of uncertainty. In addition, financial data are usuallyhighly skewed toward the majority class. With the aim of achievinghigh accuracies, preserving the interpretability, and managing un-certain and unbalanced data, this paper presents a novel methodto deal with financial data classification by adopting type-2 fuzzyrule-based classifiers (FRBCs) generated from data by a multiob-jective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). The classifiers employ anapproach, denoted as scaled dominance, for defining rule weights insuch a way to help minority classes to be correctly classified. In par-ticular, we have extended PAES-RCS, an MOEA-based approachto learn concurrently the rule and data bases of FRBCs, for manag-ing both interval type-2 fuzzy sets and unbalanced datasets. To thebest of our knowledge, this is the first work that generates type-2FRBCs by concurrently maximizing accuracy and minimizing thenumber of rules and the rule length with the objective of producinginterpretable models of real-world skewed and incomplete finan-cial datasets. The rule bases are generated by exploiting a rule andcondition selection (RCS) approach, which selects a reduced num-ber of rules from a heuristically generated rule base and a reducednumber of conditions for each selected rule during the evolution-ary process. The weight associated with each rule is scaled by thescaled dominance approach on the fuzzy frequency of the outputclass, in order to give a higher weight to the minority class. Asregards the data base learning, the membership function parame-ters of the interval type-2 fuzzy sets used in the rules are learnedconcurrently to the application of RCS. Unbalanced datasets aremanaged by using, in addition to complexity, selectivity and speci-ficity as objectives of the MOEA rather than only the classificationrate. We tested our approach, named IT2-PAES-RCS, on 11 finan-cial datasets and compared our results with the ones obtained bythe original PAES-RCS with three objectives and with and with-out scaled dominance, the FRBCs, fuzzy association rule-basedManuscript received June 26, 2015; revised September 18, 2015 and January21, 2016; accepted April 20, 2016.

Usingnonparametric statistical tests, we will show that IT2-PAES-RCSgenerates FRBCs with, on average, accuracy statistically compara-ble with and complexity lower than the ones generated by the twoversions of the original PAES-RCS. Further, the FRBCs generatedby FARC-HD and FURIA and the decision trees computed by C4.5and its cost-sensitive version, despite the highest complexity, resultto be less accurate than the FRBCs generated by IT2-PAES-RCS.Finally, we will highlight how these FRBCs are easily interpretableby showing and discussing one of them.
