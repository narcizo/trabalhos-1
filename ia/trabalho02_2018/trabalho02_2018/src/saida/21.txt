RESUMO: Abstract—The financial market always suffers from continuousand discontinuous (jump) changes and can be regarded as anonlinear stochastic jump diffusion system. Most investors expecttheir investment policies to be not only higher benefits but alsolower risk as a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP). In thisstudy, a multiobjective H2/H∞ fuzzy investment is proposed fornonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial systems to achievethe desired target with minimum investment cost and risk inPareto optimal sense, simultaneously. The Takagi–Sugeno (T–S)fuzzy model is used to approximate the nonlinear stochastic jumpdiffusion financial system to simplify the multiobjective H2/H∞investment policy design procedure. By the help of the T–S fuzzymodel, the multiobjective H2/H∞ fuzzy investment policy prob-lem of nonlinear stochastic financial system can be transformedto a linear-matrix-inequality-constrained (LMI-constrained)MOP to avoid solving the annoying Hamilton–Jacobi inequalities.Because the LMI-constrained MOP is not easy to directly calculateits Pareto optimal solutions, an indirect method is proposed tosolve this MOP for the multiobjective H2/H∞ fuzzy investmentpolicy design of nonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financialsystems. An LMI-constrained multiobjective evolution algorithm(LMI-constrained MOEA) is also developed to efficiently solvethe Pareto optimal solutions of the LMI-constrained MOP forthe multiobjective H2/H∞ fuzzy investment policy design ofnonlinear stochastic jump diffusion financial systems. When thePareto optimal regulation solutions are solved by the proposedLMI-constrained MOEA, investors can select one investmentpolicy to achieve their desired target with minimum investmentcost and risk according to his/her own preference.
