RESUMO: Abstract—This paper focuses on investigating the cross-borderfinancial contagion based on a fuzzy dynamical system scenariosimulation from a perspective of analyzing the volatility of interna-tional capital flows for a panel of 50 countries in emerging marketsand advanced economies from 1980 to 2011. Increasing evidencehas shown that financial globalization has developed into a complexnonlinear dynamical system made up of economic subsystems withextensive financial connections and linkages. The contagion effectsof the spread of bonanzas in the 50 countries are identified andanalyzed. The Hodrick–Prescott filter is employed to address thelong-term net capital inflow trend. The comovement of financialcontagion between the source country of financial turbulence andthe volatility-affected country is described as a fuzzy dynamicalsystem in which the driving and response systems are coupled. Afuzzy dynamical system scenario simulation model under a liberaleconomy is established by employing nonlinear differential equa-tions to describe the contagion mechanism and the internationalcapital flow volatility effects. The model is then extended to a dy-namical system model with macroeconomic control. The couplingstrength uncertainty is addressed by employing an interval type-2fuzzy theory method. The properties of the volatility equilibriumpoint for the two models are discussed, and the volatility conta-gion principles based on locally asymptotic stability analysis arederived to explain the different volatility transmission patterns.Manuscript received August 1, 2015; revised October 22, 2015 and January19, 2016; accepted April 20, 2016.
