RESUMO: Abstract—Traditional economic models have rigid-form transi-tion functions when modeling time-varying volatility of financialtime series data and cannot capture other time-varying dynam-ics in the financial market. In this paper, combining the Gaussianprocess state-space model framework and the stochastic volatil-ity (SV) model, we introduce a new Gaussian process regressionstochastic volatility (GPRSV) model building procedures for finan-cial time series data analysis and time-varying volatility modeling.The GPRSV extends the SV model. The flexible stochastic natureof the Gaussian process state description allows the model to cap-ture more time-varying dynamics of the financial market. We alsopresent the model estimation methods for the GPRSV model. Wedemonstrate the superior volatility prediction performance of ourmodel with both simulated and empirical financial data.
