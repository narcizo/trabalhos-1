RESUMO: Abstract— A wash trade refers to the illegal activities oftraders who utilize carefully designed limit orders to manuallyincrease the trading volumes for creating a false impression ofan active market. As one of the primary formats of marketabuse, a wash trade can be extremely damaging to the properfunctioning and integrity of capital markets. The existingwork focuses on collusive clique detections based on certainassumptions of trading behaviors. Effective approaches foranalyzing and detecting wash trade in a real-life market haveyet to be developed. This paper analyzes and conceptualizes thebasic structures of the trading collusion in a wash trade by usinga directed graph of traders. A novel method is then proposed todetect the potential wash trade activities involved in a financialinstrument by first recognizing the suspiciously matched ordersand then further identifying the collusions among the traderswho submit such orders. Both steps are formulated as asimplified form of the knapsack problem, which can be solvedby dynamic programming approaches. The proposed approachis evaluated on seven stock data sets from the NASDAQ and theLondon Stock Exchange. The experimental results show thatthe proposed approach can effectively detect all primary washtrade scenarios across the selected data sets.
