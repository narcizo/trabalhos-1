RESUMO: Abstract—Financial ratios are key constituents of bankruptcymodels. The bankruptcy prediction accuracy substantiallyimproves when a limited number of ratios are used. From the lit-erature, it has been found that human expertise has been appliedto select financial ratios for bankruptcy models. Different expertstend to have different opinions and hence the bankruptcy predic-tion results depend upon their competency levels in that domain.Accordingly, there is a need for finding a systematic methodor a tool to identify the influencing ratios. This paper developsa genetic bankrupt ratio analysis tool using a genetic algorithm toidentify influencing ratios from different bankruptcy models andtheir influences in a quantitative form. The accuracy of values ofinfluencing ratios is validated by comparing original thresholdvalue of the bankruptcy models. The performance of influencingratios has been compared with other feature selection techniquesand the Altman model is considered to explain the effect of theinfluencing ratios.
