RESUMO: Abstract—The paper aims to determine the day-ahead marketbidding strategies for retailers with flexible demands to maximizethe short-term profit. It proposes a short-term planning frameworkto forecast the load under dynamic tariffs and construct bidingcurves. Stochastic programming is applied to manage the uncer-tainties of spot price, regulating price, consumption behaviors, andresponsiveness to dynamic tariffs. A case study based on data fromSweden is carried out. It demonstrates that a real-time selling pricecan affect the aggregate load of a residential consumer group andlead to load shift toward low-price periods. The optimal biddingcurves for specific trading periods are illustrated. Through com-paring the bidding strategies under different risk factors, the casestudy shows that a risk-averse retailer tends to adopt the strate-gies with larger imbalances. The benefit lies in the reduction oflow-profit risk. However, the aversion to risk can only be kept in acertain level. A larger imbalance may lead to a quick reduction ofprofit in all scenarios.
