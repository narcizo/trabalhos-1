RESUMO: Abstract—In the highly competitive world of modern finance,new derivatives are continually required to take advantage ofchanges in financial markets, and to hedge businesses against newrisks. The research described in this paper aims to accelerate thedevelopment and pricing of new derivatives in two different ways.First, new derivatives can be specified mathematically within ageneral framework, enabling new mathematical formulae to bespecified rather than just new parameter settings. This GenericPricing Engine (GPE) is expressively powerful enough to specifya wide range of standard pricing engines. Second, the associatedprice simulation using the Monte Carlo method is accelerated us-ing GPU or multicore hardware. The parallel implementation (inOpenCL) is automatically derived from the mathematical descrip-tion of the derivative. As a test, for a Basket Option Pricing Engine(BOPE) generated using the GPE, on the largest problem size, anNVidia GPU runs the generated pricing engine at 45 times thespeed of a sequential, specific hand-coded implementation of thesame BOPE. Thus, a user can more rapidly devise, simulate, andexperiment with new derivatives without actual programming
