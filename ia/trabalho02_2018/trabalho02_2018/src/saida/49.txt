RESUMO: Abstract—This paper develops a novel approach to computationof the probability integrals encountered in derivative pricingusing stochastic models estimated from historical data. First,nonparametric probability distribution models are built directlyfrom the data as a solution of a convex optimization problemscalable to very big datasets. Second, these models are used fornumerical calculus of probability integrals, where the quadratureincludes long tails of the probability distributions. The applicationexample is the procurement contract in the day-ahead bulk marketfor electricity. The data for PJM utility loads and prices in the day-ahead and spot markets were used to estimate the risk and to pricethe contract. The data-driven forward contract pricing allows tooptimize the contract cost and reduce it by 2% compared to thebaseline; this corresponds to about $0.6B/year in potential utilitysavings.
