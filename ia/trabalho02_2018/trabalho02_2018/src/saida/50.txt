RESUMO: Abstract—This paper investigates the modeling of risk due tomarket and funding liquidity by capturing the joint dynamicsof three time series: the treasury-Eurodollar spread, the VIX,and a metric derived from the S&P 500 spread. We propose atwo-regime mean-reverting model for explaining the behaviour ofthree time series, which mirror liquidity levels for financial mar-kets. An expectation-maximisation algorithm in conjunction withmultivariate filters is employed to construct optimal parameterestimates of the proposed model. The selection of the modelingset-up is justified by balancing the best-fit criterion and modelcomplexity. The model performance is demonstrated on historicalmarket data, and a descriptive analysis of the different liquiditymeasures shows the presence of clear high and low states.
