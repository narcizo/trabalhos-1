RESUMO: Abstract—This paper is dedicated to European option pricingunder assumption that the underlying asset follows a geometricLevy process. The log-price of a primary financial instrument hasthe form of a sum of a drift component, a Brownian component,and a linear combination of time-homogeneous Poisson processes,modeling jumps in price. In our approach we apply stochasticanalysis, especially the change of probability measure techniques,as well as fuzzy sets theory. To obtain the option valuation formulaswe use the minimal variance equivalent martingale measure, whichrequires an advanced analysis of transformation of Levy charac-teristic triplets. We obtain analytical option valuation expressionsin crisp case. Moreover, we assume that some model parametersare described in an imprecise way and therefore we use their fuzzycounterparts. Applying fuzzy arithmetic, we take into account var-ious types of uncertainty on the market. As a result, we obtainthe analytical option pricing formulas with fuzzy parameters. Wealso propose a method of automatized decision making, which uti-lizes the fuzzy valuation formulas. Apart from the general pricingexpressions, we provide numerical examples to illustrate our theo-retical results.
